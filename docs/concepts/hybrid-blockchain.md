# Hybrid Blockchain

The hybrid blockchain is best defined as the blockchain that attempts to use the best part of both private and public blockchain solutions. In an ideal world, a hybrid blockchain will mean controlled access and freedom at the same time.

The hybrid blockchain is distinguishable from the fact that they are not open to everyone, but still offers blockchain features such as integrity, transparency, and security.

As usual, Hybrid blockchain is entirely customizable. The members of the hybrid blockchain can decide who can take participation in the blockchain or which transactions are made public. This brings the best of both worlds and ensures that a company can work with their stakeholders in the best possible way.

## BENEFITS:

1. **Works in a closed ecosystem:** The number one advantage of hybrid blockchain

   is its ability to work in a closed ecosystem. That means that companies or

   organizations don’t have to worry about getting their information leaked when

   taking advantage of blockchain technology.

2. **Changes the rules when needed:** Companies thrive on change. The good news

   about hybrid blockchain is that they need to change rules. However, the nature of the

   change depends on what the hybrid blockchain is trying to do. However, don’t

   expect to change data or modify transactions in a hybrid system that handles

   land registry or user identity for verification purposes.

3. **Protecting from 51% attack:** Hybrid blockchain are immune to a 51% attack as

   hackers cannot have access to the network to carry out the attack.

4. **Protecting privacy while still communicating with the outer world:** Even

   though private blockchain is best for privacy-related issues. However, they are

   limited when it comes to communicating with the outer world. Many companies may

   want to keep privacy, but also need to configure their blockchain so that they

   can communicate with all their shareholders including the public.

5. **Low transaction cost:** Another added benefit of using hybrid blockchain is to

   have a low transaction cost. Transactions are bound to be cheap as it requires

   few nodes to verify them. The most powerful nodes in the network make it easy to

   verify the transaction which may take thousands of nodes in public blockchain.

   The transaction fees can reduce to even 0.01$ per transaction.
