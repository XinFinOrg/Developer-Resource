**inFactor.io** is an open standards framework for managing **Invoices**, orders between buyers and sellers and getting access to liquidity from global financiers through a peer to peer network. inFactor.io is built on **ISO20022** based standards and can interact with data from any system in enterprise or banking and financial systems environment.

The Hybrid network architecture of XinFin allows the enterprises and institutions to host sensitive data in a private network and only relay relevant information of it on the XinFin public network.

**XDC Protocol enables the data from invoices to be standardised and shared over ISO20022 format for Invoices yet giving it immutability and verification through cryptographic hashes.** [Refer](https://www.iso20022.org/trade_services_messages.page)

XDC Protocol also allows buyers, sellers and financiers to quickly swap between any FIAT currency using XDC Protocol as a relay bridge thereby enabling instant liquidity and counterparty risk mitigation.
